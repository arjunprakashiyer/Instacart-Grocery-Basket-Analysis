#**Instacart Grocery Basket Analysis**

This Data Analysis project is done through Python using libraries of pandas, NumPy, matplotlib and seaborn.

##Objective

The project is for Instacart, an online grocery app store. The company has good sales, but they want to uncover more information about their sales patterns. The objective of the Data Analyst is to perform an initial data and exploratory analysis of some of their data in order to derive insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation based on the provided criteria.

##Context of the Project

The Instacart stakeholders are most interested in the variety of customers in their database along with their purchasing behaviors. The company assumes they can't target everyone using the same methods, and they’re considering a targeted marketing strategy. They want to target different customers with applicable marketing campaigns to see whether they influence the sales of their products. Your analysis will inform what this strategy might look like to ensure Instacart targets the right customer profiles with the appropriate products.
